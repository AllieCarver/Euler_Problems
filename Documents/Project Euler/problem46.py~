========================
Project Euler Problem 46
========================
It was proposed by Christian Goldbach that every odd composite number 
can be written as the sum of a prime and twice a square.

9 = 7 + 2×12
15 = 7 + 2×22
21 = 3 + 2×32
25 = 7 + 2×32
27 = 19 + 2×22
33 = 31 + 2×12

It turns out that the conjecture was false.

What is the smallest odd composite that cannot be written as 
the sum of a prime and twice a square?"
